                <p>My name is Gray, and welcome to my website.</p>
                <p>You are welcome to browse it's source code <a href="https://github.com/surrsurus/surrsurus.github.io">here</a>.</p>
                <p><b>Q:</b> Who are you?</p>
                <p><b>A:</b> I'm a programmer in the greater Philadelphia area. Python is my favorite language, though my GitHub might like to say otherwise. I've dabbled in mobile applications, frontend web development (as you can probably tell), robotics, game development, and plain old programming for the fun of it.</p>
                <p>I'm working towards a degree in computer engineering. I believe heavily in the GPL and FOSS compliancy, and all personal programming projects I make are open source, free as in freedom, and free to download from my GitHub.</p>
                <p><b>Q:</b> I'm a programmer/prospective employer/someone who is interested in your software and would like to see a portfolio/projects you've done.</p>
                <p><b>A:</b> Feel free to check out my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/surrsurus">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Every project I finish usually goes onto my GitHub where they are free to download for any use. If you would like to use some of my code in your projects, please note that the GPL licsense packaged with my code requires you to adopt the liscense as well. If you don't, it's fine. I don't plan to make money off of these projects, but giving credit would be nice. If any of these projects help you or are interested in anyway, let me know. If there are any problems/missing features also let me know. You can get in contact with me at <a href="mailto:gray@surrsur.us">gray@surrsur.us</a>.</p>
